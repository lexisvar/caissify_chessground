# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.8] - 2025-01-16

### üîß Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed `@move` event not firing when using custom `movable.dests` configuration
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed reactive updates to `movable` configuration being ignored due to shallow watching
- Fixed chess pieces becoming unselectable when providing legal moves via `movable.dests`
- Fixed destination square highlighting not working with custom move destinations

### üöÄ Improved
- Enhanced reactivity system to properly detect changes to nested `movable` configuration properties
- Improved move event handling to respect user-provided legal move destinations
- Better integration with chess engines like chess.js for legal move validation

### üìù Technical Details
- **ChessBoard.vue**: Modified destination handling logic to prioritize user-provided `movable.dests` over default `getBasicDests()`
- **useChessground.ts**: Changed configuration watcher from shallow (`deep: false`) to deep (`deep: true`) watching
- Added comprehensive test components for debugging and verification

### üêõ Bug Context
This release fixes a critical issue where:
1. User-calculated legal moves from chess engines were being overridden by generic destinations
2. Reactive updates to the movable configuration weren't propagating to the chessground instance
3. The `@move` event never fired because pieces couldn't be properly selected or moved

### üíî Breaking Changes
None - this is a backward-compatible bug fix.

### üß™ Testing
- Added `debug-chessboard.vue` for diagnostic testing
- Added `test-fix-verification.vue` for fix validation
- Verified compatibility with existing chess.js integration patterns

## Migration Guide

### From 1.0.7 to 1.0.8

No code changes required! This is a bug fix release that makes existing code work as expected.

**Before (broken in 1.0.7):**
```vue
<template>
  <ChessBoard
    :movable="movableConfig"
    @move="onMove"  <!-- This didn't fire -->
  />
</template>

<script setup>
const movableConfig = reactive({
  free: false,
  color: 'white',
  dests: new Map(), // This was ignored
  showDests: true
})

// This never got called
function onMove(from, to) {
  console.log('Move:', from, to) // ‚ùå Never logged
}
</script>
```

**After (working in 1.0.8):**
```vue
<template>
  <ChessBoard
    :movable="movableConfig"
    @move="onMove"  <!-- This now fires! -->
  />
</template>

<script setup>
const movableConfig = reactive({
  free: false,
  color: 'white',
  dests: new Map(), // This is now respected
  showDests: true
})

// This now gets called correctly
function onMove(from, to) {
  console.log('Move:', from, to) // ‚úÖ Works!
}
</script>
```

### Integration with Chess Engines

This fix enables proper integration with chess engines:

```javascript
import { Chess } from 'chess.js'

const updateLegalMoves = () => {
  const chess = new Chess(currentFen.value)
  const moves = chess.moves({ verbose: true })
  
  // Clear existing destinations
  movableConfig.dests.clear()
  
  // This now works correctly in 1.0.8!
  moves.forEach(move => {
    const from = move.from
    const to = move.to
    
    if (!movableConfig.dests.has(from)) {
      movableConfig.dests.set(from, [])
    }
    movableConfig.dests.get(from).push(to)
  })
  
  // Set current player
  movableConfig.color = chess.turn() === 'w' ? 'white' : 'black'
}
```
